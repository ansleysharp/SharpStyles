    <p class="ex1"> <b>How Long Will It Take To Prepare My Car?</b>
      <sub>We start by using industry standards of one week of repair time for every one-thousand dollars of damage. Then you must factor in the complexity of repairs, unforeseen delays which may occur due to additional supplemental damage, availability of parts, part delays, receipt of incorrect parts, supplemental insurance approvals and current workload of the shop.</sub>
    </p>

    <p class="ex2">  <b>If My Vehicle's Frame Is Damaged, Is It A Total Loss?</b>
      <sub>No. A car is a total loss only when the price of repairs exceeds the insurance company's determined value of your vehicle. Nowadays, most cars are built using unibody (frame and body as one) construction.</sub>
    </p>

    <p class="ex3"> <b>Can I Get Other Service Work Done On My Vehicle While It's In The Shop?</b>
      <sub>Yes you can. Just let advisors know what all you want done to your vehicle.</sub>
    </p>

    <p class="ex4"> <b>Does My Insurance Company Have The Right To Inspect My Vehicle?</b>
      <sub>Yes, they have a right to inspect your vehicle, but are not required to do so.  If your company chooses to perform an inspection, they can require you to travel a reasonable distance to complete their inspection.</sub>
    </p>

    <p class="ex5"> <b>I've Been In An Accident. Now What Do I Do?</b>
      <sub>If you have been in an accident, you need to get into contact with your insurance company. Then, after that it's your own choice to come to us.</sub>
    </p>

    <p class="ex6">  <b>How Will I Know When My Car Is Done?</b>
      <sub>You will know when your car through contacting you through your phone via call or text.</sub>
    </p>

    <p class="ex7"> <b>When Can I Wash My Vehicle?</b>
      <sub>The safest wait time is 2-3 weeks, to be on the safe side, because you want your car to be fully use to whatever has been done to it.</sub>
