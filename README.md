Overview:
My Partner, Chandler Nixon, and I created a model website for the local body shop, David White Body Shop. We aimed to make a simple yet effective website for our viewers. We used HTML code, CSS code, and even included a little bit of javascript. The company we created this for is highly rated and recommended, so we hope the website is good for their liking.

PAGES

Home page-
Our home page was one of the most difficult for us to style, due to the fact we struggled with position issues. Although, we worked on our w3schools knowledge and figured out the best way to position our content. The home page is now our favorite page! We used a cool icon bar for our navigation, border styles for our information, and even included text links. We have an embeded video to our company's review on youtube. Also, we have their logo locked on every page!

Services-
Our services page is simple, yet includes the right information. We have a basic description of the company's services as well as a photo. We used left, top, and right restrictions to style the paragraphs.

Photos-
Our photos page is simple. It includes a few basic photos taken from David White Body Shop. They're all displayed in a carousel.

Testimonials-
Our testimonials page is the page we made for "reviews". Although they're not driven straight from the website, they have good feedback for the company and were simply a model for our layout.

contact-
Our contact page includes the contact information for the business. It has the location, phone, email, and more. There is a contact sheet, which is active. You can hover the page and tell it would work if this was a truly active website.
